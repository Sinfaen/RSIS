# Project Environment
It is generally expected that users organize code into projects. New project skeletons can be generated from RSIS, which come with necessary and optional information for RSIS integration. New projects can be created with the `newproject` command.

## Necessary Files
The `rsisproject.toml` file is required to exist. The structure of the file is as follows:

```
[rsisproject]
type = "rust" # Can be either "rust" or "cpp"
filepaths = [] # List of file paths to add upon project load
```

## Rust Setup
Rust projects 

## C++ Setup
C++ projects currently only support the Meson build system.

- meson_options.txt
   - This file is used to provided information about the installed location of RSIS. The default autogenerated `meson.build` file will utilize this file to link against RSIS headers for compilation.
- meson.build
The Meson build file. Comes with template code for building a model.

## Model Library Search Paths

### Rust

### C++
The meson build directory is recursively searched for available shared libraries to load.
